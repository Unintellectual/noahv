                I'm retatively poor, so I don't have a lot of fancy stuff. But here are the things I use on a daily basis:<br>

                <span class="bold">Hardware</span><br>

                <span class="bold">&#8226; Laptop</span>: HP 15dw1000 - i5 10210U, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 500GB HDD. This is a laptop that I repaired that is why it has a lot of cracks and when I got it, It has no battery, destroyed back panel.<br>

                <span class="bold">&#8226; Monitor</span>: LP156WHB TP A2 15.6" 1366x768 60Hz. This is a laptop screen that I salvaged from a broken laptop. I use it as a secondary monitor for my laptop.<br>

                <span class="bold">&#8226; Keyboard</span>: A4 Tech - This is a cheap keyboard I bought in bundle for around 250 php. I've been using this for 5 years which aside from scratches there is noting wrong with it. Great keyboard tbh<br>

                <span class="bold">&#8226; Mouse</span>: Rakk Altis  - This is a cheap mouse I bought for around 300 php. Great mouse for big hands and it's made in the Philippines <span class="bold">#SupportLocal</span>.<br>

                <span class="bold">&#8226; IEMs</span>: QKZ A6 pro - This is actually a nice sounding IEM. I never want to wear headphones it just hurt my ears especially when extended use.<br>

                <span class="bold">&#8226; Phone</span>: Realme Note 50 - This phone I bought for 3.5k php. Nothing special about it. I just use it as an mp3 player and messages.<br>

                <span class="bold">Software</span><br>
                I have a highly configured Arch Linux setup with i3wm and a lot of custom scripts.I have a lot of custom scripts that I use for automation and productivity. I plan to make a dotfiles repo but I'm too preoccupied by other things for now.<br>
